# Terminal
 The following contains all the configuration for my terminal.

 ## iTerm2
 I use iTerm2 as my preferred terminal on the mac. It can be installed with: 
 ```zsh
 brew cask install iterm2
 ```
iTerm provides some neat functionality that the preinstalled Terminal does not include.

## Colors

I use the color scheme of 'obsidian.itermcolors' in my terminal. If you wish to use this as well, simply import the file within this repo. You can find more amazin color schemes at [iTerm2-Color-Schemes](https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes).
