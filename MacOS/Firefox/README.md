# Firefox
Besides Safari, I am also using Firefox on my Mac.

## Why Firefox
Firefox has much better customizability than Safari.
This is basically the reason why I sometimes prefer it.

## Extensions
I use the following Extensions for my Firefox:
- [Momentum](https://momentumdash.com) for a nice Landing Page
- [Grammarly](https://grammarly.com) for Speeling Correction
- [Instapaper](https://instapaper.com) for organizing Posts
- [Tree Style Tab](https://piro.sakura.ne.jp/xul/_treestyletab.html.en) for having the Tabs on the Left
- [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#ublock-origin) as my AdBlocker
- [Vimium](https://github.com/philc/vimium) for Vim Keybindings

## Appearance
To make this look nice, I prefer the tabs and adress bar to disappear. This is done by placing the userChrome.css in the
Firefox profile folder.
